# Deferred work

Items consciously deferred during M1–M6, collected from the per-section reviews
so they aren't lost. Grouped by area; priority is P1 (should fix before a real
release) → P3 (nice-to-have / measure-first). Nothing here is a known-wrong
result on the tested paths — these are gaps, edges, and polish.

## Codegen features (biggest gaps)

| id | pri | item | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| CG1a | ✅ | **Generics — type-erased** | Done. A type parameter is a plain pointer on the wire, so a parameter-typed field (and an explicit `:AnyPointer`) emits type-erased accessors: reader `has_<f>()` + `get_<f>_struct/list/text/data()`; builder `init_<f>_struct/list/composite_list()` + `set_<f>_text/data()`. Generic structs themselves get normal classes (`Box(T)` → `Box`); brand bindings ignored — the caller resolves the concrete kind from the binding it knows statically. Union-arm AnyPointer setters write the outer discriminant. Bidirectional interop-verified. Schema: `tests/golden/generic.capnp`; test: `tests/integration/test_generic.gd`. Also covers the AnyPointer half of CG6. |
| CG1b | P1 | **Generics — monomorphized** (`Brand` resolution) | Layer fully-typed per-instantiation classes on top of CG1a's erased base: resolve `Brand.Scope`/`Binding` from the CGR and emit a concrete class per binding tuple (`Box(Text)` → `Box_Text` with `get_value() -> String`). Recursive (bindings thread into nested generic types) and combinatorial. Largest remaining feature; CG1a is the unbound floor it falls back to. |
| CG2 | ✅ | **Reserved-name sanitization** | Done. Type names (class/enum) colliding with a Godot type (`ClassDB.class_exists` + Variant types) or GDScript keyword get a trailing `_` (`Color`→`Color_`, `Node`→`Node_`); field stems colliding with keywords or Object getters (`class`/`script`/`meta`) too (`get_class_`). Cross-refs stay consistent via `flat_by_id`. Interop-verified (capnp decode reads the original names). Test: `tests/integration/test_reserved_names.gd`. |
| CG3 | ✅ | **Named (non-union) groups** | Done. A `:group { ... }` with no discriminant flattens to `get_<group>_<field>()` / `set_<group>_<field>()`; recurses for nested groups, delegates to the union emitters for a union nested in a group (its enum is emitted too — `state.mode` → `enum StateMode`). A named group that is a struct-level union arm gets `is_<group>()` + flattened getters; its setters thread the outer discriminant (closed via CG4). Bidirectional interop-verified. Schema: `tests/golden/groups.capnp`; test: `tests/integration/test_groups.gd`. |
| CG4 | ✅ | **Nested union in a struct-level union** | Done. A union-group, named group, or slot that is an arm of a struct-level union threads the OUTER discriminant into every leaf setter (outer `which()` written before the inner arm + value); the reader gets the outer `is_<arm>()` selector. Void inner arms write both discriminants. Bidirectional interop-verified. Schema: `tests/golden/nested_union.capnp` (+ the `Outer` struct in `groups.capnp`); tests: `tests/integration/test_nested_union.gd`, `test_groups.gd`. |
| CG5 | ✅ | **Data field defaults** | Done. A `Data` field with `hadExplicitDefault` emits its authored bytes as an inline `PackedByteArray([...])` literal (constructor form — expression position has no annotation to coerce a bare `[...]`, and `const` Packed* is C1-broken); the getter passes it as the `get_data(off, default)` fallback. Interop cross-check: a capnp-encoded all-default message read through the generated reader yields the byte-exact authored default. Schema: `tests/golden/defaults.capnp` (`dataf`/`datas`/`emptyd`); test: `tests/integration/test_defaults.gd`. |
| CG6 | P2 | **Interface field types** | AnyPointer fields now handled by CG1a (type-erased accessors). Interface/capability fields still emit no-op stubs (`null` getter, `pass` setter) — they decode to a table index at runtime but codegen has no accessor yet. |
| CG7 | P3 | **Cross-file type references** | Multi-file schemas (`import`/`using`) — a field of an imported type isn't in the current file's `flat_by_id`; `_flat_of` returns "" → valid-but-`null`/`Variant` stub + `push_error`. Need a cross-file name map. |
| CG8 | P3 | **`List(Void)` element** | `_emit_list_setter` falls a void element through to the primitive path emitting `_b.init_list(off, CapnPointer.ElemSize.POINTER, n)` — wrong elem size for a void list (capnp uses the empty/zero element size; a `List(Void)` carries only a length). Getter side maps to untyped `Array` of `null` (harmless). No schema exercises it today. |

## Codegen quality / typing

| id | pri | item | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| CQ1 | ✅ | **Typed `Array[T]` list returns** | Done. List getters return `Array[<Elem>]` (`Array[X.Reader]`, `Array[String]`, `Array[int]`, …) and composite-list setters return `Array[X.Builder]`; the container is born typed so indexed writes need no C3 `.assign()`. Erased/unresolved elements (AnyPointer, list-of-list, interface, void, cross-file struct) stay untyped `Array`. Enum elements map to `Array[int]` (CQ2 covers enum-typed). Typed-local guards in `tests/integration/test_codegen.gd`. |
| CQ2 | ✅ | **Enum-typed returns (D10a)** | Done. Enum-typed field getters return the generated enum type (`get_u16(...) as <Enum>`), setters take the enum-typed param, and enum lists are `Array[<Enum>]` — int at the wire, enum at the API boundary. Cross-file/unresolved enums fall back to `int`. Union discriminant readers (`which()` / `<g>_which()`) stay `int` (synthetic tag, not a schema enum) — a future enhancement could return the generated `Which`/`<Group>` enum. Locked by the addressbook golden byte-compare + an enum-typed-local guard. |
| CQ3 | ✅ | **`_pascal` ALLCAPS / `_snake` acronym runs** | Done. `_snake` splits at the end of a capital run that starts a new word (`HTTPServer`→`http_server`, `parseHTTPRequest`→`parse_http_request`); `_pascal` upper-cases each part's first letter explicitly (no Godot `capitalize()` tail-lowercasing). All existing goldens regenerated byte-identical (zero regression). Schema: `tests/golden/acronyms.capnp`; test: `tests/integration/test_acronyms.gd`. |
| CQ4 | P3 | **`_scalar_set` TEXT/DATA computes unused `def`** | `_default_for` runs for text/data setters but the literal is unused (text/data don't XOR on write). Short-circuit. |
| CQ5 | P3 | **Typed containers (H10b)** | `_index_nodes`/`_collect` and threaded `by_id`/`flat_by_id` params are plain `Dictionary`/`Array` despite carrying known shapes. Type the signatures. |
| CQ6 | P3 | **Struct-level union untested** | Codegen supports struct-level unions (`which()` + `is_*`) but only group-unions are covered by tests. Add a struct-level-union test schema. |
| CQ7 | P3 | **Golden compile-check warning** | `test_generated_sources_compile` reload()s a source whose `class_name` is already registered → benign `"hides a global script class"` log. Strip `class_name` before the isolated compile, or accept the noise. |

## Runtime perf (measure-first — DOD inline checklist)

| id | pri | item | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| RT1 | P3 | **Packed codec hot-loop allocs** | `wire_packed` builds output via per-word `append`; pre-size + indexed writes if profiling shows it. |
| RT2 | P3 | **Reader `_buf()` 3-hop** | `msg.segments.segments[seg_id]` per primitive read; cache the buffer ref in the reader if hot. |
| RT3 | P3 | **`read_u64` naming** | `CapnWireWords.read_u64` returns a possibly-negative bit pattern; consider `read_u64_bits` to surface that. No callers today. |

## Packaging (the rest of M7)

| id | pri | item | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PK1 | ✅ | **`tools/build_capnp.sh`** | Done. Builds `capnp` from a checkout (cmake/ninja, no sudo); prints the binary path. |
| PK2 | ✅ | **README** | Done. Install, the `capnp compile -o gdscript` workflow, env vars, runtime-codec usage. Workflow verified verbatim. |
| PK3 | ✅ | **GUT CI script** | Done — `tools/run_tests.sh` (import + GUT headless, propagates exit code). |
| PK4 | ✅ | **Editor plugin panel** | Done. `plugin.gd` is a dock: capnp status, one-click Install (downloads the platform binary from our GitHub releases via `CapnInstaller`), Browse-to-existing, and a schema→out-dir Generate that runs `capnp compile -o-` + `CapnCodegen` in-process (`CapnTool`, no CLI/PATH/env). CI (`capnp-release.yml`) builds capnp for linux/macOS/windows on release. The published addon ships no binary (Asset-Store-clean). Network/CI paths are manual-verify; the in-process generate + extraction are tested. |
| PK5 | ✅ | **Repo folder rename** | Done — repo is `capngodo`. |
| PK6 | P2 | **Verify Windows codegen on real Windows** | `tools/capnpc-gdscript.cmd` + the shimless 2-step are documented but UNTESTED on a real Windows host (developed on Linux). The plugin itself (`plugin_main.gd`) is cross-platform. Open Q: does capnp spawn a `.cmd` plugin via `-o gdscript` on Windows? If not, the shimless 2-step is the fallback. |

## Accepted as-is (documented, not bugs)

- Empty-`PackedByteArray`-on-error ambiguity in `xor_bytes`/`pack`/`unpack` (only ambiguous when input is legitimately empty; errors also `push_error`).
- Unchecked enum casts (`x as NodeWhich`, etc.) in the meta-reader — input is trusted capnp output; would only drift on an upstream schema version bump.
- Non-canonical builder output (cross-segment uses double-far always; orphaned bytes when a union member is re-set) — spec-valid, just not minimal.
